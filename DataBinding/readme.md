# Runtime Data Binding in Unity UI Toolkit
## Example / Tutorial C# Source Code
This code shows how to use runtime data binding of visual elements to data models in Unity 6 and UI Toolkit. 
We cover a few examples of common controls: a text field, list view, Dropdown and then triggering a 
change to the data model using Unity events.

All examples should run in Unity 6 and above.
