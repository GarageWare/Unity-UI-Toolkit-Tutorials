# Unity UI Toolkit Tutorials Example Code
## Introduction
This repository contains example code for the Unity UI Toolkit tutorials created by Garage-Ware Games. The code is organized into folders corresponding to each tutorial, and each folder contains a README file with instructions on how to run the example code.

### Unity Examples
Some code in this repo is copied directly from the Unity documentation. The original code can be found in the Unity UI Toolkit Example Repository:
https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ui-toolkit-manual-code-examples which, while being a terrific reference, is not complete as not all examples work without modifications or structure changes.

The code in this repo is intended to be used as a supplement to the Unity documentation and tutorials with the items we have copied here being working versions of there examples.
All code from Unity is in the WorkingUnityExamples folder and have the minimum changes needed to make the examples usable in a runtime environment.
