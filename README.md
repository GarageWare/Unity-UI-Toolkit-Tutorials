# Unity UI Toolkit Tutorials Example Code
## Introduction
This repository contains example code for the Unity UI Toolkit tutorials created by Garage-Ware Games.
https://www.garage-ware.com/tutorials/visual-elements

The code is organized into folders corresponding to each tutorial, and each folder contains a README file with instructions on how to run the example code.

### Current Tutorials Covering This Repository
[Understanding Data Binding from C# scripts in Unity UI Toolkit](https://www.garage-ware.com/tutorials/visual-elements/data-binding)<br>
[Build a Runtime Inventory View using Data Binding in Unity 6 UI Toolkit](https://www.garage-ware.com/tutorials/visual-elements/simple-inventory-databinding-example)


### Unity Examples
Some code in this repo is copied directly from the Unity documentation. The original code can be found in the Unity UI Toolkit Example Repository:
https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ui-toolkit-manual-code-examples which, while being a terrific reference, is focused on editor window examples and 
incomplete on runtime examples that are working without modifications or structure changes.

The code in this repo is intended to be used as a supplement to the Unity documentation and tutorials with the items we have copied here being working runtime versions of their examples.
All code from Unity is in the *WorkingUnityExamples* folder and have the minimum changes needed to make the examples usable in a runtime environment.

We have recently updated the tutorial with new documentation and code examples.
The older version of the source code can be accessed in the ```data-binding-v1``` branch
